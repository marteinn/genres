# Genres
Genres is a python library (2.7) that guesses the genres for text with musical context.

## How it works
Genres is based on a list of genres and tags (database), those are then compared against supplied text using regexp and points for ranking are calculated. Found genres are compared agains its main category to avoid mismatches.

## Usage

The api is simple.

    >>> import genres
    >>> r = genres.find("Pink Floyd is a rock band)
    >>> r
    ['rock']
    
It detects multiple genres, as long as they are related to the same category

    >>> import genres
    >>> genres.find("Acid jazz, an electronic masterpiece.")
    ['acid jazz', 'jazz']
   	
In this example the two occurences of electronic and techno triumps rock.
   	
    >>> import genres
    >>> genres.find("Electronic music with a techno vibe. Different from rock")
    ['techno', 'electronic']



## Database

The database is a simple list of words, separated by newline and structured like this:

|Data|Description|
|-------------|:-------------:|
|Rock|Main category|
|Rock|Sub category|
|Metal,0.8|Sub category, Percentage of full rank (10*0.8=8)|
|-Pink Floyd|Tag associated to category rock|
|#Test|Comment|
||Categories are sparated with newline|
|Jazz|...|
|Post-bop|...|

Genres are distributed with a database that can be found under `genres/data.txt` and the genre structure is based on [Allmusic genre categorisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popular_music_genres).

It is possible to supply your own database:

    import genres

    db_obj = genres.db.Db("./example.txt")
    finder_obj = genres.finder.Finder(db_obj)

## Installation
Genres can easily be installed through pip.

    $ pip install genres
